# Acquiring dataset

1. Run `wget wget https://dyslexia.computing.clemson.edu/BET_BSE/BSE_BET_DATA.zip --no-check-certificate` to download the dataset into your local machine. 
2. Unzip the file and locate the *files/* directory and *labels.csv* file.

# Notes

The project requires setting up tensorflow with conda due to certain dependencies not written in Python.

Modify the paths to the *files/* directory and *labels.csv* file in the source code.
